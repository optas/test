Because there is a partial face in the lower right corner, I infer that the expression is always there.  By showing the eyes looking downward and the lips closed, you know it is not portraying the typical wonderment of a child.  The very young are easily amused and smile alot.  There are no tears, so it is not a normal reaction to some event.  This child experiences melancholy on a regular basis which makes me sad.  The shading is dark, which also suggest sadness.  Hard lines outline most of the face, suggesting a lack of softness or baby qualities.

They are finding out the latest gossip or discussing philosophy or socrates yet there is a naked guy at the corner that seems to playing with a piano. Kind of out of place from everyone else. No one is making a big deal of his nakedness. Different sizes of people like what is up with the really white guy with white leotards by the naked guy. The grim reaper?

The shadows and dark green lining of her cloak give the illusion of 3 dimensions.  The subjects are placed within the Golden Mean--Mary to the right and Jesus on the left, and her circling hands tie the piece together.  I wonder what Jesus is looking at off to the left.  The skin tones look jaundiced, and should be paler, but the lights and shadows on them are accurate.  The fingers touching Jesus don't make any imprints, and this is not realistic, especially on a fat baby which would dimple easily.  Another thing I find confusing is Mary's sleeve, which shows far too much embroidered detail for a poor woman who rode a donkey and gave birth in a stable.  The landscape looks to be somewhere pines grow (northern Italy?)  Overall, a very peaceful work of art.

It's a resurrection scene but it comes across as goofy and amusing simply due to how much the artist got wrong.

It all reeks of the worst instincts of medieval religious art that fails to research the location and history it portrays.
