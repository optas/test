Because there is a partial face in the lower right corner, I infer that the expression is always there.  By showing the eyes looking downward and the lips closed, you know it is not portraying the typical wonderment of a child.  The very young are easily amused and smile alot.  There are no tears, so it is not a normal reaction to some event.  This child experiences melancholy on a regular basis which makes me sad.  The shading is dark, which also suggest sadness.  Hard lines outline most of the face, suggesting a lack of softness or baby qualities.
